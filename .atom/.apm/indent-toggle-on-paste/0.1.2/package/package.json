Instead of passing by the settings panel to deactivate it for a moment, this package put a keyboard shortcut to a command which will toggle the mecanism, paste the content of your clipboard, then reset the setting value to its previous state.\n\n**Note:** this package is kinda like in beta: it works in cases I need it, but I still doesn't understand some specific cases of auto-indenting from Atom's core.\n\n* * *\n\n## Keymaps\n\n**On Mac OS X:** `cmd-shift-v`\n**On Windows & Linux:** `ctrl-shift-v`\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/leny/atom-indent-toggle-on-paste/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/leny/atom-indent-toggle-on-paste#readme","_id":"indent-toggle-on-paste@0.1.2","_shasum":"5a3c725912b5023fb6671c152d32fc0935e2d663","_resolved":"file:../d-1151011-7549-sa8plf/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151011-7549-sa8plf/package.tgz"}
