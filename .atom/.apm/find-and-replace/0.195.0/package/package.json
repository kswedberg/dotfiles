The service exposes one method, `resultsMarkerLayerForTextEditor`, which takes a `TextEditor` and returns a `TextEditorMarkerLayer` that you can interact with. Keep in mind that any work you do in synchronous event handlers on this layer will impact the performance of find and replace.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace#readme","_id":"find-and-replace@0.195.0","_shasum":"d1f48e6b97f53bb25bc0effe23d8f073f7388d94","_resolved":"file:../d-1151114-20301-1gpmpcv/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151114-20301-1gpmpcv/package.tgz"}
