# indent-toggle-on-paste package

> Add a shortcut to toggle the auto-indent mecanism on paste

* * *

Sometimes, when you paste text, the `Auto Indent On Paste` mecanism can bother you. Instead of passing by the settings panel to deactivate it for a moment, this package put a keyboard shortcut to a command which will toggle the mecanism, paste the content of your clipboard, then reset the setting value to its previous state.

**Note:** this package is kinda like in beta: it works in cases I need it, but I still doesn't understand some specific cases of auto-indenting from Atom's core.
