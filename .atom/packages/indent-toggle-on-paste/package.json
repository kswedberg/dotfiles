Instead of passing by the settings panel to deactivate it for a moment, this package put a keyboard shortcut to a command which will toggle the mecanism, paste the content of your clipboard, then reset the setting value to its previous state.\n\n**Note:** this package is kinda like in beta: it works in cases I need it, but I still doesn't understand some specific cases of auto-indenting from Atom's core.\n\n* * *\n\n## Keybindings\n\nWith the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that will not enter in conflict whit anyone else's packages, so I have removed the default keystrokes and let the keymap empty to let you set your own keybindings.\n\nSee [keymaps/indent-toggle-on-paste.cson](https://github.com/leny/atom-indent-toggle-on-paste/blob/master/keymaps/indent-toggle-on-paste.cson) for suggestions.\n",
