# dot files

These are the dot files for my MacBook Pro. A lot of the stuff in here was
taken from the illustrious Mathias Bynens (https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

This repository does not include the `.oh-my-zsh` directory.

The `.profile` and `.zshrc` files are symlinked to my home directory.

Files in the `init` folder should probably run only once, typically on a fresh
install.

You probably won't want to run the `init/osx.sh` wholesale. Instead, go in
there and either comment out all the lines you don't want to run
first, or grab the settings line by line and paste them in the terminal.
